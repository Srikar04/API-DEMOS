# API Demonstration Project

This repository contains four distinct projects showcasing the implementation of SOAP and REST APIs. The projects are structured into separate folders:

1. **SOAP**: Contains examples and solutions to problems solved using the SOAP protocol.
2. **E-Commerce App**: A REST API-based e-commerce application demonstrating CRUD operations for products, categories, and orders.
3. **Record App**: A REST API-based application for managing records, including creation, reading, updating, and deletion of user records.
4. **Social Media App**: A simple social media platform implemented using REST APIs, allowing CRUD operations on users, posts, and comments.
